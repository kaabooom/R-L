## ðŸ§  Environment Overview

CartPole is a classic control problem provided by [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/). The goal is to balance a pole on a moving cart by applying forces to the cart.

- **Observation Space**: 4 continuous variables
  - Cart Position
  - Cart Velocity
  - Pole Angle
  - Pole Velocity at Tip
- **Action Space**: Discrete (2)
  - `0`: Push cart to the left
  - `1`: Push cart to the right
- **Reward**: +1 for every timestep the pole remains upright
- **Episode Termination**:
  - Pole angle > Â±12Â°
  - Cart position > Â±2.4 units
  - Episode length â‰¥ 500 (solved if average reward â‰¥ 475 over 100 episodes)
